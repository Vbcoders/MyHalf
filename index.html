<b>My Dear....</b>
<br>
This journey with you was very happy and lucky to have you like this <br>
I want to tell you one thing there are so many struggles and pressures are occured till now in our relationship <br> 
I hope you will understand me I think I don't need to explain everything to you bcz you know very well what I'm
Falling in love with you was the best thing that happened to me.<br> Your feel make me selfish sometimes...<br> 
Your presence make me forget the world<br>
Your have a different place in my life<br>
Sorry for everything I do that feel sad and angry to you this is not intentionally hope you will understand....<br>
A lot of things change with time, including feelings for people. Even though you hold a special place in my heart, our relationship has come to the point where I don‚Äôt feel that we connect like before."<br>
